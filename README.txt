Welcome! This is my personal website, which I based on the Strata template of HTML5 UP and have changed greatly according to my own needs.

Doing this project has given me great experience in frontend development, and some backend as well.

I've practiced my HTML and CSS skills, and learnt Javascript and CSS on the way too :)

You can visit my website at https://serhanyilmaz.me

Give it a look and contact me!
